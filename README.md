# 2d Finite Element Simulations for Fluid and Heat Flow
## Danilo Naiff

A number of finite element simulations for heat and fluid flow in Python, as part of a class in Computational Heat Transfer. This is here mostly for recording, but I also believe that this code may be instructive for some, as well as extensible for future simulations.
